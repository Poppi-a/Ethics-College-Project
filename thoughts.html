<h1>My unfiltered thought about biotech</h1>

<p>
    Thoughout this site we have talked about how amazing biotech can be, with making our crops bountiful and helping people live,
    to it harming the environment and killing a few people. All in all, biotechnology is something so complicated
    but it seems that we can draw some clear boundaries for it, adleast for most of it. There are still very weird and
    interesting things I haven't covered yet, like meat being used as a cpu, or controller for a computer. We are at a point
    in biotech where the line is bluring and ethics are getting harder to really dictate rules for biotech. Is the meat technically 
    alive? It's talking and communicating but though computer terms. Where do we draw the line exactly?
</p>

<p>
    For most of the stuff there is a clear line. For crops, and plant editing, so long as it dosen't affect human health or
    the environment it's all good. Gene editing with humans still doesn't seem safe enough to do, so long as it is reasurched
    without directly involving humans, that's all good too. When it comes to religion it gets a bit more complicated. Religion 
    and biotech just do not mix well, adleast for most religions. How can we deal with that? Honestly I'm not super sure. The least 
    we can do is simply to respect them, and try not to cross the line too much, but honestly science has to get better, and 
    as science gets better it will almost always go against something in religion. Biotech can also be used in very very bad ways.
    For example, bio warfare, it hasen't happened much, but it has happened. more than 500 million people died of infectious
    diseases. Several tens of thousands of these deaths were due to the deliberate release of pathogens or toxins, mostly by
    the Japanese during their attacks on China during the Second World War. Luckily laws are in place now to prevent that stuff
    anymore. 
</p>

<p>
    When it comes to gene reading, and learning about ourselves from them, I think it should be a safe, and a totally normal
    thing to do, that should not affect insurance or any form of medical care. The fact that that was even brought up legally
    from the sources I read made me worried about the future reguarding medical care insurance. I think that's most of my thoughts 
    about everything. I think biotech is super cool, and the ethics for it right now seem pretty decent. I hope you enjoyed
    reading though all this mess, and I had fun in your class. I hope you have a wonderful holiday.
