<h3>Jesse Gelsinger 1999</h3>

<p>
    In 1999, a 18 year old named Jesse Gelsinger died while participating in a gene therapy trial at the university
    of Pennsylvania. The university was draged into a huge debate, as inadequate information was disclosed on the consent 
    documents, leading Jesse to not know the full length of what he was getting himself into. After this many places and 
    regulators began implementing new standards as a result of this incident. The article addresses the conundrum of cost
     sharing potentially backfiring, especially when patients are willing to try new therapies. Patient rush into experimental
      treatments necessitates rigorous protection by review committees, particularly for treatments like gene therapy
       and vaccines.

<h3>
    The Human Genome Project
</h3>

<p>
    The ability to decode the human genome raises significant concerns about patient privacy. As scientists gain proficiency
    in deciphering genetic information, the likelihood of compromising details about an individual's future health increases.
    While decoding dna is a great way to find health conditions, family, and shows how exactly your body is built, sometimes it can 
    give information that is hard to take. For example, what would you do if you had a baby that got their genes read, and they find
    that the baby will have a serious heart disease later in life? How will this impact job opportunities, insurance eligibility,
    or mortgage approvals? There's a tension between the insurer's fiduciary responsibility to control costs and the ethical
    obligation to protect patient confidentiality. Despite some protection offered by HIPAA, the expansion of diagnostics 
    will likely bring these privacy issues to the forefront. Legal challenges and litigation may be necessary to establish 
    boundaries and resolve ethical dilemmas related to genetic information.
